<a name="inspiration" class="anchor" href="#inspiration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inspiration:</h2>

<p>At a gallery event, here in San Francisco, I was inspired by one of my fellow artists who included the code for his generative art in the final print. It got me thinking about Code Reflection and how itâ€™s used, and how I might play with these ideas visually. After percolating on it for awhile, I started writing some python code that takes itself as input and draws an image based on the text of that code.</p>
