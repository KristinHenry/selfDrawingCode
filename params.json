It got me thinking about Code Reflection and how itâ€™s used, and how I might play with these ideas visually. After percolating on it for awhile, I started writing some python code that takes itself as input and draws an image based on the text of that code.\r\n\r\n## More information:\r\nFor more on my creative process at the beginning of this project, please see this [blog post on Self-Drawing Code](http://www.underground-flash.com/2013/07/self-drawing-code_24.html).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
